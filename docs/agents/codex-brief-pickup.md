# Codex Brief Pickup

Use this guide when a master/advisor session says a substrate-resident
brief is waiting for Codex. Default to the CLI/TOON read path so pickup works
without MCP discovery; use shell for git, build, test, and PR work.

## Default CLI/TOON Flow

1. Run `AIDA_AGENT_OUTPUT=toon aida brief list --for-agent codex`.
2. If no briefs are returned, report `no pending briefs for codex` and stop.
3. Pick the oldest pending brief unless the operator names a different one.
4. Run `AIDA_AGENT_OUTPUT=toon aida brief read <path>` using the path returned
   by the list command.
5. Read the full brief before editing. The `## Setup` section is the intended
   worktree/lease bootstrap; the `## Trailer reminder` section is the commit/PR
   trailer contract.
6. Once you proceed with the pickup, run
   `AIDA_AGENT_OUTPUT=toon aida brief ack <path>`. Acking is idempotent, so a
   repeated call on an already-acked path is safe.
7. Implement from the brief, verify locally, and ship with `aida pr ship`.

## Optional MCP Flow

1. Call `list_briefs({agent: "codex"})`.
2. If no briefs are returned, report `no pending briefs for codex` and stop.
3. Pick the oldest pending brief unless the operator names a different one.
4. Call `read_brief({path})` using the path returned by `list_briefs`.
5. Read the full brief before editing. The `## Setup` section is the
   intended worktree/lease bootstrap; the `## Trailer reminder` section is
   the commit/PR trailer contract.
6. Once you proceed with the pickup, call `ack_brief({path})`. Acking is
   idempotent, so a repeated call on an already-acked path is safe.
7. Implement from the brief, verify locally, and ship with `aida pr ship`.

## MCP Fallback Boundary

MCP is an opt-in convenience for structured reads/writes, not a prerequisite
for the lane. If MCP is unavailable or too expensive for the current context,
keep using CLI/TOON for brief and spec lookup, and use MCP only when a typed
coordination write is worth it.

## Safety Notes

- Treat brief files as local runtime state under `.aida/agent-briefs/`.
- Do not edit brief files by hand unless recovering from a tool failure.
- Do not auto-claim a spec merely because a brief exists; follow the setup
  section and the current worktree/session discipline.
- If a brief references architecture-class work without a sketch verdict,
  stop and ask for master sign-off before implementing.
