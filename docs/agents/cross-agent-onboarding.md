# AIDA MCP — Onboarding Brief for Non-Claude-Code Agents

*Audience: any MCP-speaking coding agent (Codex, Cursor, Continue, custom Claude Agent SDK runtime, etc.) being attached to an AIDA project. 2026-05-22.*

This brief is what you need to know to participate productively in an AIDA project. It assumes you can speak MCP, run shell commands, and read/write files in a worktree.

For agent-session communication details that cut across Claude, Codex, and
Antigravity, see `docs/agents/session-communication.md`. That file is the
durable reference for hook pause/abort/defer behavior, brief routing, and
which substrate channel to use when an agent must stop, ask, or resume.

For client-specific MCP configuration surfaces, marketplace/package channels,
and safe default write-tool posture, see
`docs/agents/aida-mcp-install-matrix.md`. Keep that matrix updated whenever a
major agent client changes its MCP config path or marketplace model.

## What AIDA is

AIDA (AI Design Assistant) is a **spec-graph-backed agent-collaboration layer**. The visible surface is a Rust CLI (`aida`) and a small TUI; the actual product is the substrate underneath:

- Every requirement (spec, story, bug, task, epic) has a **stable identifier** that survives renames/refactors.
- Specs have **typed relationships** to other specs (parent/child, blocked-by, depends-on, etc.).
- Code references back to specs via inline **`trace:SPEC-ID | ai:<tool>`** comments.
- The whole graph is **git-canonical** (orphan branch `aida-store`, one YAML per spec) with a SQLite read-cache (`.aida/cache.db`, rebuildable).
- An **MCP server** (`aida mcp-serve`) exposes the graph and the coordination layer to any MCP-speaking agent — that's where you come in.

The strategic positioning: the IDE-embedded coding assistants (Cursor, Cline, Aider, Claude Code) make a human at the keyboard faster. **AIDA is the substrate beneath the IDE-agent war** — the shared spec-graph + coordination tools that whatever agent you use can be given structured context through. You're not competing with Claude Code by using AIDA from Codex; you're using the same substrate, just through MCP instead of through `.claude/skills/`.

## What you can do via MCP today

AIDA's MCP server exposes **58 tools** in six clusters:

**Important:** the canonical argument names come from `tools/list` over MCP. The list below mirrors what the server actually advertises (verified via `aida-cli/src/mcp.rs` inputSchema descriptors). If a future edit to this doc drifts from the source, **trust `tools/list`**, file a finding, and `aida` will fix the doc.

### Cluster 1 — Spec graph (12 tools)

- `list_requirements({status})` → list specs (optionally filtered)
- `show_requirement({id})` → full spec content, relationships, comments
- `add_requirement({title, description, type, ...})` → file a new spec. `type` is required and must be one of the canonical taxonomy values: `functional`, `non-functional`, `system`, `user`, `change-request`, `bug`, `epic`, `story`, `task`, `spike`, `sprint`, `folder`, `meta`, `principle`, `vision`, `constraint`, `decision`, `term`, `doc` (the last five — `principle`/`vision`/`constraint`/`decision`/`term` — are the ADR + knowledge-graph family). AIDA auto-assigns the ID prefix from that type (for example, `task` → `TASK-N`), so agents should not invent generic `SPEC-N` IDs.
- `update_requirement({id, ...})` → edit
- `search_requirements({query})` → FTS5 search
- `add_comment({id, text})` → comment on a spec  *(arg is `text`, not `body`)*
- `add_relationship({spec_id, relationship_type, target_spec_id, bidirectional?, force_parent?})` → add a typed relationship between existing specs. Built-ins include `parent`, `child`, `duplicate`, `verifies`, `verified-by`, `references`, `blocked-by`, and `blocks`; `depends-on` aliases to `blocked-by`, and custom non-empty names are accepted for CLI parity.
- `query_graph({spec_id, mode?, depth?, follow?})` → query the cross-spec relationship graph from a root spec, equivalent to `aida graph`. `mode` ∈ `tree` (Parent/Child descendants + status rollup, default), `blocked-by` / `blocks` (transitive chains), `impact` (reverse closure — what is blocked by the root). `follow` (array of type names, e.g. `["begets"]`) traverses arbitrary custom/built-in edge types outgoing, overriding `mode` (FR-282). Returns JSON `{root, mode, count, nodes:[{id,title,status,resolved}], rollup}`. The typed-graph query a flat per-feature spec store can't answer.
- `send_message({body, to?, broadcast?, thread?, in_reply_to?, from?})` → send an inter-agent peer message, equivalent to `aida mailbox send`. Address one agent via `to` or set `broadcast: true`. Distinct from briefs (operator→agent work) and directives (top-down control): agent↔agent conversation.
- `read_inbox({agent?})` → an agent's inbox (messages to it + broadcasts, excluding own-sent, oldest-first), equivalent to `aida mailbox inbox`. Returns JSON `{agent, count, messages}`.
- `list_features()` → list project features
- `history({spec_id?, since?})` → structured event ledger, equivalent to `aida history events`

These mirror the `aida list / show / add / edit / search / comment / history` CLI verbs. **Use them for any spec-graph interaction.** Don't shell out to `aida` for these. *(STORY-82 and EPIC-27 will modernize the older spec-graph tools to match the coordination tools' vocabulary and capability — until then, expect a thinner surface than the coordination cluster.)*

### Cluster 2 — Coordination (17 tools, STORY-361 + STORY-426)

- **Punt channel:**
  - `post_punt({spec_id, detail, category?, lean?, raised_by?})` — required: `spec_id`, `detail`. Append a punt record to `.aida/punts.jsonl`. Does NOT modify spec status — pair with `update_requirement` to flip to `needs-attention`.
  - `list_punts({status?})` — list punt records
  - `read_punt({spec_id})` — read the most recent punt for a spec
  - `resolve_punt({spec_id, answer, reasoning, classification?})` — required: `spec_id`, `answer`, `reasoning`. Write a PuntResponse marking the punt resolved.
  - `escalate_punt({spec_id, reasoning, escalation_reason?, classification?})` — required: `spec_id`, `reasoning`. Kick a punt to a human.

- **Findings channel:**
  - `file_finding({title, description, source?, spec_id?, pr?, kind?, severity?})` — required: `title`, `description`. File a triage-able draft TASK with appropriate `from-*` tags.
  - `list_findings({pr?, source?, kind?})` — list findings.
  - `triage_finding({id, action, reason?})` — required: `id`, `action`. Promote (Approved) or dismiss (Rejected) a finding.
  - **`file_finding` is for TRIAGEABLE ITEMS only** — a bug or task the project should act on. It is NOT a session journal or a phase-completion checkpoint. Filing "Phase 1 verification complete" / "Phase 2 outcome: clean" as findings just creates draft TASKs the advisor has to dismiss (empirical: a 3-phase verification once filed 4 such "findings", 3 dismissed + 1 duplicate). For checkpoints / intermediate status / session journals use instead:
    - `aida session manifest` — the per-session brief,
    - `add_comment` on the spec you're working — progress notes that live with the work,
    - local agent-side notes (`walkthrough.md`, scratch files) — anything not meant for project triage.
  - Litmus test — **good finding:** `"TOCTOU race in claim_task"` (a bug to fix). **Bad finding:** `"Phase 1 complete"` (a status update — belongs in a comment or the manifest).

- **Task-claim channel:**
  - `claim_task({spec_id, role?})` — required: `spec_id`. Atomic lease on a queued spec (writes `.aida/sessions/<lease>.toml`).
  - `release_task({lease_id})` — required: `lease_id`. Delete the lease.
  - `list_active_leases()` — list all active leases.

- **Directive channel** (control plane over `.aida/worker.cmd`):
  - `post_directive({verb, args?})` — required: `verb`. Verbs: `drain`, `pause`, `exit` (per `aida-worker` discipline). Note: `args` must be a JSON array of strings (e.g., `["arg1"]`), not a bare string. Directives coordinate the local worker session thread flow, which is distinct from global queue commands.
  - `list_directives()` — list pending directives.
  - `ack_directive({index})` — required: `index`. Remove a directive by its 0-based position.

- **Agent-brief channel** (pickup briefs under `.aida/agent-briefs/<agent>/`):
  - `list_briefs({agent?, include_acked?})` — list substrate-resident pickup briefs; defaults to pending/unacked only.
  - `read_brief({path})` — read the full markdown brief content. Use paths returned by `list_briefs`.
  - `ack_brief({path})` — mark a brief acknowledged using the same `.acked` suffix convention as `aida brief ack`; idempotent when already acked.

These are the **agent-coordination primitives**. They're how multiple agents (you, a human, another agent) coordinate on the same spec graph without stepping on each other.

### Cluster 3 — Queue (9 tools, STORY-532 / EPIC-27)

These mirror the `aida queue <subcommand>` CLI surface so MCP-speaking agents can manage the work queue without shelling out. They call the same `Storage::queue_*` library functions the CLI handlers use (no subprocess to `aida`) and resolve the queue `user_id` through the same `current_user_id` chain as the CLI (`user` → `AIDA_USER` → `USER` → `USERNAME` → `default`, per BUG-89), so MCP and CLI operate on one queue.

- `queue_list({user?, for?, all?, ...})` → list queued work items (optionally filter by role via `for`, or span users via `all`).
- `queue_next({user?, for?, all?, ...})` → **peek** at the head of the role queue (read-only; resolves what `aida queue next` would surface, does not mutate).
- `queue_progress({batch?, specs?, ...})` → progress of a `batch:NAME` or an explicit `specs` set. *(The session-manifest default the CLI uses needs cwd + leases, which MCP has no handle on; `batch` / `specs` are the portable axes.)*
- `queue_work({id?, user?, for?, all?, ...})` → **peek**, not launcher (read-only): resolves the spec `aida queue work` would pick up (named `id` or role-queue head) and instructs you to run the CLI to actually launch the session — the CLI launches a Claude session in a fresh worktree, which an in-process MCP tool must not do.
- `queue_add({id, user?, top?, note?, for?, scope?, force?, ...})` → enqueue a spec (required: `id`).
- `queue_done({id, user?, ...})` → mark a queued item done (required: `id`).
- `queue_rework({id, user?, for?, status?, reason?, force?, ...})` → send a spec back for rework (required: `id`).
- `queue_move({id, user?, top?, bottom?, before?, after?, ...})` → reorder a queue item (required: `id`).
- `queue_remove({id, user?, ...})` → remove a queue item (required: `id`).

### Cluster 4 — Session (5 tools, STORY-533 / EPIC-27)

These mirror the `aida session <subcommand>` CLI surface so MCP-speaking agents can inspect scoped session leases + planned-cluster manifests without shelling out. The three inspectors read `.aida/sessions/*.toml` directly (no subprocess to `aida`). The two mutating verbs are **peeks**, not actors: `aida session start` / `aida session end` perform subprocess-driven acts (creating/removing a git worktree, exec'ing or terminating `claude`, probing PR/CI), which an in-process MCP tool must not do — so the MCP tools resolve/describe the work and hand back the exact CLI command to run (the `queue_work` peek precedent).

- `session_leases({all?, ...})` → list active scoped session leases (the "who holds what right now" view). `all` also includes lightweight MCP claim markers.
- `session_status({id?, ...})` → details for one lease (scope/branch/worktree/role/owner/hostname/started_at, plus inline manifest progress). `id` (8-char prefix) optional when exactly one session is active.
- `session_manifest({id?, ...})` → a session's planned-cluster manifest with per-item status (✓ done / ◐ started / ○ pending). **Read mirror** — writing/marking the manifest stays CLI-only (it needs the active session's cwd context and happens automatically as `aida edit` / `queue done` run).
- `session_start({owns, branch?, role?, launch?, ...})` → **peek**, not launcher (read-only): validates the scope/role and returns the `aida session start` command to run; warns when the scope is already held (required: `owns`).
- `session_end({id?, spec?, ...})` → **peek**, not actor (read-only): resolves the lease `aida session end` would target and returns the CLI command to run.

### Cluster 5 — Role (4 tools, STORY-534 / EPIC-27)

These mirror the `aida role <subcommand>` CLI surface so MCP-speaking agents can inspect the project's personas (hats) without shelling out. The two inspectors read the role TOML directly — `.aida/roles/*.toml` plus `~/.aida/roles/*.toml` (no subprocess to `aida`). The two mutating verbs are **peeks**, not actors: `aida role enter` / `aida role end` set/clear the *shell's* `AIDA_SESSION_ROLE` env var (role identity is shell-keyed, the same way the queue user is — see **BUG-89**), which an in-process MCP tool cannot do for the calling agent — so the MCP tools resolve/describe the role and hand back the exact CLI command to run (the `queue_work` / `session_start` peek precedent).

- `role_list({...})` → list the project's roles (and any global roles), newest-active first; the active shell role is marked `*`.
- `role_show({name?, ...})` → details for one role (purpose / created / last-active / cwd / notes / scope / prompt addendum). `name` optional when a role is active in the launching shell; the legacy `dialog` name resolves to `advisor`.
- `role_enter({name, cd?, ...})` → **peek**, not switcher (read-only): validates the role exists and returns the `aida role enter` command to run, plus the resolved role context (required: `name`).
- `role_end({...})` → **peek**, not actor (read-only): reports the active shell role and returns the `aida role end` command to run.

### Cluster 6 — Workflow (11 tools, STORY-536 / EPIC-27, TASK-715)

The remaining `aida` CLI long tail. Seven are read-only library mirrors — they compute in-process from the same helpers the CLI uses (cache reads, the plan-lint pass, the ultraplan assembler, the goal-clause builder, the usage-log aggregator), with no subprocess to `aida`. Three are git-network / working-tree / store mutations driven by subprocess `git` (`db_sync` / `fetch` / `pull`); surfacing those as in-process MCP mutations would surprise the caller (working-tree changes, remote pushes), so they are **peeks**, not actors — they return the exact `aida …` command to run (the `queue_work` / `session_start` peek precedent).

- `cache_status({...})` → read-cache freshness for the git-canonical store (cached vs store counts, last-built, cache/store HEAD SHAs, FRESH/STALE verdict). Reads `.aida/cache.db` + the orphan store HEAD directly. **Read mirror** — rebuilding stays CLI-only (`aida cache rebuild`).
- `plan_verify({file, ...})` → lint a plan file (drifted line refs, missing sections, unresolved paths). **Read mirror** of `aida plan verify` — the `--fix` in-place rewrite stays CLI-only (required: `file`).
- `plan_helpers({spec, ...})` → derive a `## Reusable helpers` section from the trace graph. **Read mirror** of `aida plan helpers` — the `--append` file write stays CLI-only (required: `spec`).
- `ultraplan_assemble({spec, no_comments?, ...})` → assemble a rich planner prompt for a spec (description + acceptance + graph context + helpers). **Read mirror** of `aida ultraplan --stdout` — clipboard / deep-link stays CLI-only (required: `spec`). trace:BUG-1177
- `goal_derive({batch?, epic?, spec?, pr?, queue_empty?, ...})` → derive a machine-checkable `/goal` condition (clauses AND-compose, each inlining its verification command). At least one axis is required. Copy / invoke stays CLI-only.
- `status_unified({user?, ...})` → a lightweight in-process status snapshot (requirement counts by status, active session leases, queue depth). The CI-bearing surface of `aida status` (PR/CI rollup, awaiting-you gates) shells out to `gh` and stays CLI-only — also see `aida://project/summary` / `aida://session/leases`.
- `usage_query({since?, unused?, errors?, limit?, ...})` → query the local usage telemetry log (top commands, error-rate ranking, or deprecation candidates). **Read mirror** of `aida usage` / `aida usage errors` / `aida usage unused <window>` — the `aida usage drains` / `aida usage health` orchestrator views stay CLI-only.
- `db_sync({pull?, push?, ...})` → **peek**, not actor (read-only): returns the `aida db sync` command to run (git network I/O against the orphan store branch).
- `fetch({code_only?, store_only?, quiet?, ...})` → **peek**, not actor (read-only): returns the `aida fetch` command to run (refreshes remote refs via git network I/O).
- `pull({code_only?, store_only?, ...})` → **peek**, not actor (read-only): returns the `aida pull` command to run (mutates the working tree + local store, auto-bumps merged specs).
- `schema({object?})` → introspect the storable substrate (mirrors `aida schema [<object>] --json`). With no `object`, returns the catalog of storable object kinds; with `object` (e.g. `requirement`), returns that object's detail — for Requirement, the reflection-derived field table plus the four controlled-vocabulary enums (status / type / priority / relationship) in on-the-wire token form (a paste-ready cheat-sheet for `--status` / `--type` / `--priority` / relationship-type arguments). Reflection-derived, so it can't drift from `models.rs`. **Read mirror** — also addressable as the `aida://schema` / `aida://schema/{object}` resources below (TASK-715).

### MCP resources (live state — STORY-535 / EPIC-27, TASK-715)

Resources are a **distinct MCP concept from tools**: addressable read-only state you fetch via `resources/read` (and discover via `resources/list` / `resources/templates/list`), not verbs you invoke via `tools/call`. They back onto the same library helpers the equivalent CLI surfaces use — no subprocess to `aida`. Seven resources today:

- `aida://project/summary` — project statistics + feature list.
- `aida://requirements/tree` — requirement hierarchy overview.
- `aida://queue/in-flight` — specs held by a live session/MCP-claim lease, plus the Done-awaiting-merge bucket (mirrors `aida queue list --in-flight-only`).
- `aida://session/leases` — active scoped session leases (mirrors `aida session leases`).
- `aida://schema` — the catalog of storable object kinds as JSON (mirrors `aida schema --json`); per-object field/enum detail via the `aida://schema/{object}` template. Same data as the `schema` tool above (TASK-715).
- `aida://pr/{n}` *(template)* — git-canonical, gh-free PR linkage for PR number N: merged specs whose squash-merge subject carries `(#N)`, plus review findings tagged `from-review:PR-N`.
- `aida://batch/{name}` *(template)* — progress buckets (Shipped / In flight / Working now / Remaining) for the `batch:<name>` tag set (mirrors `aida queue progress --batch`).
- `aida://schema/{object}` *(template)* — per-object schema detail (mirrors `aida schema <object> --json`); every catalog kind is a reflection-derived field table, `requirement` additionally carries the controlled-vocabulary enums (TASK-715).

The `{…}` URIs are **resource templates** (advertised on `resources/templates/list`); the `resources/read` handler matches them by prefix and parses the tail (`aida://pr/<n>`, `aida://batch/<name>`, `aida://schema/<object>`).

> **Schemas:** all 58 tools advertise `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`. Successful responses carry both the MCP text content envelope (back-compat) and `structuredContent` matching the `outputSchema` (Path B, **STORY-399**). Parse either; text remains the back-compat floor.

## How to connect (minimum viable)

The MCP server runs locally. From inside an AIDA project (any directory containing a `.aida/` directory):

```bash
aida mcp-serve
```

That's the server. Configure your MCP client to connect to it. For a Codex client, use `docs/agents/codex-mcp-setup.md`; STORY-398 verified the local Codex roundtrip and captured the working steps.

A `.mcp.json` is scaffolded at project init for Claude Code MCP integration. Other MCP clients typically need their own config; the connection target is the same `aida mcp-serve` process. Auth is local-socket today; cross-machine + auth is a deferred SPIKE.

`aida mcp-serve` is a long-running process, but it now checks the on-disk `aida --version` after each handled request. If the package version is newer, or the same version has a different build SHA, the server flushes the current response and self-respawns so the next MCP request uses the new binary. If a client still appears stale, kill that agent's `aida mcp-serve` process and let the MCP client respawn it.

When working from an AIDA source checkout, `cargo run -p aida-cli -- pr ship` is supported. The wrapper reinvokes the current development binary for post-merge `aida pull` and `aida session end`, so agents do not need an installed `aida` on `PATH` just to complete the ship flow.

## Conventions you should follow

When you participate in an AIDA project — whether as implementer, reviewer, advisor, or other role — these conventions matter:

### 1. Spec IDs in code comments

When you write code that implements a spec, add an inline trace:

```rust
// trace:TASK-440 | ai:codex
fn add_output_schemas() { ... }
```

Format: `// trace:<SPEC-ID> | ai:<agent>[:<confidence>]`. The `<agent>` is your name (codex, cursor, claude, etc.). Confidence is high (implied), `med` (40-80% AI), or `low` (<40% AI). **SPEC-IDs live in code, commits, and plan files — never in user-facing CLI output or `--help` text** (those leak internal identifiers to first-users).

### 2. Commit message format

```
[AI:codex] feat(scope): description (SPEC-ID)
```

- `[AI:codex]` prefix when the commit includes AI-assisted code (any file with a `trace:` comment).
- `type` is required: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- `(SPEC-ID)` parenthesized at the END of the subject — the auto-bump scanner looks here.
- End multi-paragraph commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: <Your Agent Name> <noreply@…>`.

### 3. PR titles mirror commit subjects

Use the same format. PR bodies should reference the spec(s) being addressed.

### 4. Tag canonicalization (file_finding specifically)

When filing a finding from a reviewer perspective, use `from-review:PR-<NUMBER>` (with the PR-prefix). When from an implementer perspective, use `from-implementer:<SPEC-ID>`. **TASK-437** just fixed a bug where pr-as-string in `file_finding` produced non-canonical tags; the now-canonical form is `PR-<NUMBER>` with prefix.

### 5. Lease-aware operations

Before claiming a spec, check `list_active_leases()`. Don't overwrite another agent's in-flight work. If you must take over, do so explicitly via `release_task(other_lease_id)` followed by your own `claim_task`. Don't silently race.

### 6. Punt when you can't safely resolve

If you hit a design fork you can't resolve from the spec text, the surrounding code, or the project's substrate (memories, discipline docs, prior commits): **call `post_punt` instead of guessing.** Punting is a first-class outcome, not a failure. AIDA's punt → advisor → human escalation tier (STORY-306) is designed around the assumption that agents punt when uncertain.

## Cross-agent skill-invocation surface

Different agent types have different conventions for invoking AIDA workflows (the bundled "skills" like `aida-pickup`, `aida-pr`, etc.). The substrate IS the same — only the operator-facing syntax varies. If you're a non-Claude agent looking at a CLAUDE.md or skill template that references `/aida-foo`, this map tells you the equivalent.

| Workflow | Claude Code (slash) | Codex CLI | Antigravity CLI / MCP agents | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **aida-pickup** | `/aida-pickup [SPEC]` | `aida queue work [SPEC]` (or `.codex/skills/aida-pickup` when scaffolded) | `aida queue work [SPEC]` | Read spec + transition to in-progress + drive implementation |
| **aida-pr / pr ship** | `/aida-pr` | `aida pr ship` | `aida pr ship` | Commit + push + open PR + auto-queue reviewer story |
| **aida-req** | `/aida-req` | `aida add --type <T> --title <S>` | `aida add ...` (or MCP `add_requirement`) | File a new spec |
| **aida-commit** | `/aida-commit` | `git commit` with trailer | `git commit` with trailer | Enforce `[AI:tool] type(scope): subject (SPEC-ID)` format |
| **aida-implement** | `/aida-implement [SPEC]` | `aida show <SPEC>` + edit + ship | `aida show <SPEC>` + edit + ship | Implement a spec end-to-end |
| **aida-doc** | `/aida-doc` | manual file edits + commit | manual file edits + commit | Document architecture/design |
| **aida-search** | `/aida-search <q>` | `aida search <q>` (or MCP `search_requirements`) | `aida search <q>` (or MCP) | FTS5 search across specs |
| **aida-plan** | `/aida-plan [SPEC]` | `aida plan verify` / `aida ultraplan` | same | Plan an implementation; verify against template |
| **aida-findings** | (slash variants) | `aida findings add/list/promote/dismiss` (or MCP `file_finding`) | `aida findings ...` (or MCP) | Advisor observation entry + triage flow |
| **aida-onboard** | `/aida-onboard` | read AGENTS.md + this doc | read AGENTS.md + this doc | First-session orientation |

**Foundational rule**: `aida` CLI verbs are the substrate — Claude Code's slash commands and Codex's skill descriptors wrap them. If you don't know the slash/skill name for your agent type, run the CLI verb directly. It works for every agent type.

**MCP path (always available)**: regardless of agent type, the `aida mcp-serve` MCP tools (the 58 documented above) are the canonical machine-to-machine surface. Use MCP for spec-graph and queue operations; use CLI for orchestration verbs that manage live process state (`aida session start`, `aida pr ship`, and the actual launch behind `aida queue work`, etc.) since those manage substrate state that doesn't fit a stateless MCP call.

## What's in flight / known rough edges

Specs you'll want to track because they affect your operation:

| Spec | What it does | Status (as of this brief) |
|---|---|---|
| **TASK-440** | Adds `outputSchema` descriptors to the MCP tools | Shipped |
| **TASK-438** | Fixes TOCTOU race on `claim_task` (two concurrent claims could both succeed) | Approved |
| **BUG-310** | MCP-created specs not consistently visible to local CLI | Shipped |
| **STORY-398** | Empirical Codex roundtrip + `docs/agents/codex-mcp-setup.md` | Shipped |
| **STORY-399** | Path B — emit `structuredContent` matching `outputSchema` | Shipped (additive: text envelope preserved) |
| **STORY-82** | Modernize the older spec-graph tools to current CLI vocabulary | Approved, post-STORY-398 |
| **EPIC-27** | MCP server modernization: mirror the full AIDA CLI surface | Strategic container; ongoing |
| **BUG-307** | Orchestrator auto-cleans dormant leases (reduces "lease stuck" friction) | Shipped |
| **BUG-311** | `aida queue work --steal` reliability fix for dormant-lease cleanup | Shipped |

If you hit a rough edge in any of these areas, **file it via `file_finding`** rather than working around it silently. The finding becomes substrate the project uses to fix it.

AIDA's bet is that the next phase of agent collaboration isn't "smarter agents" but "shared substrate that all agents can coordinate against." Today every coding agent runs in its own isolated context window with its own scratchpads and its own private notes. Switching agents — or running multiple in parallel — means losing context.

The MCP server is the **substrate-as-shared-coordination-surface** made operational. When you (Codex / Cursor / future agent) attach to an AIDA project and use these 29 tools, you're not running on AIDA's island; you're contributing to a graph that Claude Code, the human, and any other agent are also working in. Findings filed via MCP show up in `aida findings list`. Punts you raise route to the same advisor tier human punts route to. Briefs routed to you can be listed, read, and acknowledged through MCP. Specs you implement get traced via the same `trace:SPEC-ID` convention any other agent uses.

This is what makes the "agent-agnostic" positioning real rather than rhetorical. Your participation evidences it.

## When you encounter friction

File it via `file_finding`. The substrate captures the friction so it can be fixed. The next agent (or the next session of you) inherits the fix rather than rediscovering the problem. That's how the project gets better.

If something is broken in a way that prevents you from doing useful work — `aida mcp-serve` won't start, a tool returns unexpected errors, the schema doesn't match the body, anything that blocks — fall back to `post_punt({spec_id, detail: "tool dysfunction: …", category: "tool-error"})`. The advisor tier will escalate to a human.
