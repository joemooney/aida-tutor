# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Codex CLI, MCP-compatible agents, etc.)
working in this repository. The block delimited by HTML comment markers
below is auto-generated from `.claude/AIDA.md` on each
`aida scaffold apply` — edit that file (the markers themselves are
intentionally machine-readable, so leave them in place). Anything
outside the marked block is yours to tailor.

# AIDA Conventions

This file is the single source of truth for AIDA's coding conventions in
this project. CLAUDE.md imports it via `@.claude/AIDA.md`; AGENTS.md
inlines a copy inside auto-generated delimiters. Edit this file to change
the conventions for both.

## Requirements management

This project tracks requirements with [AIDA](https://github.com/joemooney/aida).
**Do not maintain a separate `REQUIREMENTS.md`** — the requirements DB is
canonical.

Requirements database: distributed git-canonical store at `.aida-store/` (orphan branch `aida-store`, plus a rebuildable SQLite cache at `.aida/cache.db`).

Currently tracking **6** requirement(s).

### Daily commands

```bash
aida list                              # list all requirements (cache-backed)
aida list --status draft               # filter by status
aida show <ID>                         # show details (e.g. `aida show FR-0042`)
aida search "<query>"                  # full-text search
aida add --title "..." --type <type> --status draft
aida edit <ID> --status in-progress
aida edit <ID> --status completed
aida comment add <ID> "implementation note..."
aida rel add --from <ID> --to <ID> --type <Parent|Verifies|References>
aida history                           # what was touched recently (digest)
aida statusline                        # one-line: project · role · queue · cache
```

### Requirement-first development

1. **Before coding:** check whether the work has a SPEC-ID. If not, create one
   (`aida add --type <task|story|bug|...> --status approved --title "..."`).
2. **During coding:** add inline trace comments referencing the SPEC-ID.
3. **Before committing:** mark the requirement `completed` (or `in-progress`
   if work continues), and ensure the commit message references it.

## Inline trace comments

Add a comment near the code that implements (or fixes, or verifies) a
requirement:

```rust
// trace:FR-0042 | ai:claude
fn implement_feature() { /* ... */ }
```

Format: `// trace:<SPEC-ID> | ai:<tool>[:<confidence>]`

- `<SPEC-ID>` — e.g. `FR-0042`, `BUG-1-017`, `TASK-0344`
- `<tool>` — `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `human`, `aider`, …
- `<confidence>` — optional: `high` (implied), `med` (40-80% AI), `low` (<40% AI)

## Commit message format

```
[AI:tool] type(scope): description (REQ-ID)
```

Examples:

```
[AI:claude] feat(auth): add login validation (FR-0042)
[AI:claude:med] fix(api): handle null response (BUG-0023)
chore(deps): update dependencies        # no REQ-ID needed
docs: update README                     # no REQ-ID needed
```

Rules:

- `[AI:tool]` required when commit includes AI-assisted code (any file with a
   `// trace:... | ai:tool` comment changed).
- `type` required: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`,
   `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- `(scope)` optional — component or area affected.
- `(REQ-ID)` required for `feat`/`fix`; optional for `chore`/`docs`.

Set `AIDA_COMMIT_STRICT=true` (or commit through the `/aida-commit` skill) to
enforce; otherwise the commit-msg hook just warns on non-conforming messages.

## Capture proactively, not reactively

The requirements DB is only valuable when it stays in sync with reality.
Treat `/aida-capture` as a habit, not a safety net:

1. **Spec-first when introducing a new theme.** New command, new field on a
   core model, new skill, new architectural pattern — pause and `aida add`
   *before* the implementation commits. ~2 min cost; saves backfill later.
2. **Don't reuse one EPIC as a catchall.** When the work has drifted from
   what the EPIC was originally about, that's a signal to create a new EPIC,
   not stretch the existing one.
3. **Run `/aida-capture` at natural pauses.** End of focused work, before
   compaction, when stepping away. Five-minute pass that catches missed reqs.
4. **Yellow flag at >5 untracked commits.** Five+ feat/fix commits without a
   matching requirement → offer to capture before continuing.
5. **Trace comments must match reality.** A `// trace:EPIC-N` on code that
   has nothing to do with EPIC-N is misinformation that compounds. If you're
   unsure which spec a piece of work belongs to, that's the signal it needs
   its own.

## Glance at the statusbar

`.claude/settings.json` wires `aida statusline` into Claude Code's status
bar. It shows project · active role · queue depth · cache freshness. If the
role you expect isn't there, you forgot to `aida role enter <name>` before
starting the session.

## Codex / MCP-specific notes

### MCP integration

If AIDA is configured as an MCP server (`.mcp.json` is auto-scaffolded),
these tools are available:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_requirements` | List requirements with optional status/type filters |
| `show_requirement` | Show full details by SPEC-ID |
| `search_requirements` | Search by keyword across titles + descriptions |
| `add_requirement` | Create a new requirement |
| `update_requirement` | Update status / priority / owner |
| `add_comment` | Add an implementation note |
| `list_features` | List feature categories |

To configure for Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add aida -- aida mcp-serve
```

### Non-interactive workflows (codex exec)

```bash
# Implement a specific requirement
codex exec "Implement FR-042. Use 'aida show FR-042' to see the details first."

# Sprint standup
codex exec "Run 'aida list --status in-progress' and 'git log --since=yesterday'. Generate a standup report."

# Capture untraced work
codex exec "Review today's git commits. For each, check if trace comments exist. Create requirements for untraced code."
```

### Commit attribution

When committing on behalf of Codex, use the `[AI:codex]` prefix per the
commit format spec in the AIDA-AUTOGEN block above.
