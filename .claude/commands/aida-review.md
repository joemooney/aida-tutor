# AIDA Review

Drive a PR review to completion — checklist, verdicts, fix-forward, merge, mark-complete.

## Usage

```
/aida-review              From inside a reviewer session whose scope is PR-N, auto-detect
/aida-review --pr 7       Explicit PR number
/aida-review --merge-only Skip the per-spec walk, just gate on CI and merge if green
/aida-review --delegated  Opt-in to delegated review via @claude review once trigger
```

## Instructions

Follow the workflow in `.claude/skills/aida-review/SKILL.md`:

1. Resolve the PR number from the active session lease's scope, or accept `--pr N`
1a. `aida review claim --pr N` to mark PR-N under review, so a merge surface refuses to land it before your verdict; `aida review record` (step 6) clears it
2. `aida review prompt --pr N --write .aida/review-prompt-pr-N.md` to generate the per-spec checklist (STORY-67)
3. Walk each spec: read the diff against acceptance criteria, run the test plan, post a ✅ PASS / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ FAIL verdict with evidence
4. Fix-forward mechanical issues (fmt drift, cfg-gated tests, typos) as small commits; never fix-forward semantic gaps
5. Gate on CI green (`gh run watch` if a run is in-flight)
6. **Record the verdict FIRST** — before the PR comment, before any merge, before exit.
   This is the orchestrator's phase-3 → phase-4 handshake; a review that skips it reads as
   "the review did not complete" no matter how good the prose verdict was, and the PR comment
   is only its human-facing projection. Run:

   ```
   aida review record <SPEC> --pr N --verdict approved|request-changes|rejected \
     --summary "one line of why" \
     --finding "concrete issue for the rework implementer"
   ```

   The verb writes both the spec verdict and the handshake file
   `.aida/review-verdicts/PR-N.json` at the DRIVE ROOT — correctly even if you checked the PR
   out into another directory, which is exactly the case where a hand-written file lands
   somewhere the orchestrator never looks. (Hand-writing the JSON — `{"verdict": "Approved",
   "summary": "…", "mode": "orchestrator-phase-3", "findings": []}`, verdict one of `Approved` /
   `RequestChanges` / `Rejected` — still works, but only from the original repository root.)
   Under a headless drain, when a merge needs a human (irreversible migration, uncertain
   provenance), add `"merge": "escalated-to-human"` to the handshake file instead of merging.
7. Post a consolidated review comment with the verdict table
8. Interactive sessions: pause for explicit user confirmation before `gh pr merge N --squash`.
   Headless (`--no-human`) sessions: never prompt — act on the verdict-file default
9. After merge: `aida edit X --status completed` for every spec that PASSed; leave partials/fails In Progress
10. If a STORY-66 auto-queued `Review PR-N` story exists, mark it Completed too via `aida queue done`
11. Hand off — the user runs `aida session end` themselves from outside the worktree

Pairs with `/aida-pr` (implementer side) and `/aida-code-review` (orthogonal exhaustive audit — NOT a substitute).
