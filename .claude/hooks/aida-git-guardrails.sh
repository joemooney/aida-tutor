# AIDA Git Safety Guardrails — PreToolUse hook for Claude Code
#
# Blocks destructive git operations that could cause data loss:
# - git reset --hard (discards uncommitted work)
# - git clean -f (deletes untracked files)
# - git checkout -- . (discards all changes)
# - git push --force / -f / --force-with-lease to a protected branch
#   (main/master/develop/aida-store); plain --force/-f to any branch
# - git branch -d/-D/--delete of a PROTECTED branch (main/master/develop/
#   aida-store/repo default); deleting a feature branch is allowed
# - git stash drop (permanently drops stashed work)
# - git rebase without confirmation context
#
# Install: add to .claude/settings.json hooks.PreToolUse
# The hook reads the tool input from stdin as JSON.
