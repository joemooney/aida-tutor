# AIDA Advisor Code Guard — PreToolUse hook for Write|Edit|MultiEdit (STORY-670)
#
# Makes the advisor role boundary a TRIPWIRE instead of fine print. When a
# session running as role=advisor tries to edit CODE (not specs/plans/docs),
# soft-blocks the FIRST such edit and hands the decision back to the agent:
# switch role, route the work, or have the operator enable solo mode. Fires
# ONCE per session (a marker), so after the agent acknowledges/routes — or just
# repeats the edit — work proceeds. It's a nudge, not a wall.
#
# Why a gate, not a CLAUDE.md rule: prose does not bind a confident LLM under
# load (the gate-vs-rule finding — controlled ablations could not reproduce
# rule-dropping, yet it happens in the field). This is substrate-as-bouncer for
# the advisor=specs-not-code invariant, symmetric to the TASK-647 queue-add gate
# (which already refuses queue writes from a non-advisor).
#
# Suppressed (exit 0, silent) when ANY of:
#   - the session role is not advisor
#   - AIDA_AUTO_COMPLETE is set (orchestrator / drain implementer child)
#   - solo mode is active (~/.aida/solo.toml) — operator sanctioned coding here
#   - the target file is not code (specs/plans/docs/config are advisor work)
#   - this session already fired once (per-session marker)
#
# Install: .claude/settings.json hooks.PreToolUse matcher "Write|Edit|MultiEdit".
# Hooks run under their shebang (bash) when invoked as an executable path.

⛔ You are in the ADVISOR seat — specs, routing, and review, NOT implementation.
This is a code edit. Before writing source, pick one:
  • aida role enter implementer              — switch hats and implement it yourself
  • aida queue add <SPEC> --for implementer  — route the work to an implementer
  • aida solo                                — operator-sanctioned: code + integrate from this seat
(This fires once per session. If you intend to proceed anyway, repeat the edit.)
